    modify only impl units.
    every impl unit should have a JSON list of protocol types it implements
    under attribute named "type_declarations".
    E.g. if impl unit implements type A which slot X is Y and attribute W is Z, 
    then impl unit should have an attribute "type_declarations" == [
    {"name": "A", "slots": {"X": "Y"}, "attributes": {"W": "Z"}} ]
