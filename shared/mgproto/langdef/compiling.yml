      following type_declarations attribute implement serialization 
      ONLY OF SELECTED types located in "types" slot using python's struct library
      use ">" parameter (big-endian option) when serializing with struct
      define a python function for each type that needs to be serialized:
      def serialize_$typename(parameters declared for specified type) -> bytes:
          serialization...
      if serializer parameters are represented by single entity (object of some class), then
      get protocol type's field from fields of this entity.
      respect python's name convention: convert any camelCase to snake_case
      remove above comments
    </instruction>
    <code>
      import struct

j2me_impl:

  template: |
    <instruction>
      following the specified guide slot for the impl unit and type_declarations
      attribute implement deserialization ONLY OF SELECTED TYPES located in "types" slot
      using java's DataInputStream.
      define a java public method for each type that needs to be serialized:
      public <lang target type> read$typename() {
          deserialize from `DataInputStream dis` field of this
      }
      for each target java type import it from "dataclasses_package_name" slot,
      * import should not be present! Import each class separately.
    </instruction>
    <code>
      import java.io.DataInputStream;
    
      public class Deserializer {
          DataInputStream dis;
      
          public Deserializer(DataInputStream dis) {
              this.dis = dis;
          }
      
          // here go deserialization methods
      }
    </code>
